The source code of REWEIGHT_GEOMFES is included in the src/ directory.

In order to avoid errors on PLUMED-NEST, a local copy of Pablo Piaggi's pair
entropy code is also included in the na/ directory. This code was downloaded
from https://sites.google.com/site/pablompiaggi/scripts/pair-entropy-cv.
To work with the LOAD command, all these code files had to beconcatenated into
a single file and its includes modified.

These input files support the following article:
